    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
    Southeastern Asia.
    <p>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
        the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6]
        Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
